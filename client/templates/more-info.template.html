<h3>About the Site</h3>
<p>
  I wanted to create a place where people would feel safe sharing their stories. We all too often
  bite our tongues in the face of discrimination. The normalization of hate needs to end.
  Even if you are not ready to share your story, this site will give you information
  on your rights and who can help should you need it.
</p>

<p>
  In the words of former Attorney General to the United States Loretta Lynch "But
  while I cannot guarantee the absence of prejudice â€“ I can guarantee the presence
  of justice."
</p>

<p>
  The more information we have on discrimination, the more we can do to fight it. Find
  the first step to justice here. Let's map hate out of the picture.
