  <h3 class='about'>About the Site</h3>
  <p class='info'>
    My name is Sarah Graves Smith and I completed a three month intensive coding course for JavaScript at The Iron Yard.
    For my final project I wanted to create a place where people would feel safe sharing their stories. We all too often
    bite our tongues in the face of discrimination. The normalization of hate needs to end.
    Even if you are not ready to share your story, this site will give you information
    on your rights and who can help should you need it.

  <p class='info bold'>
    In the words of former Attorney General to the United States Loretta Lynch "But
    while I cannot guarantee the absence of prejudice â€“ I can guarantee the presence
    of justice."
  </p>

  <p class='info'>
    The more information we have on discrimination, the more we can do to fight it. Take your
    the first step toward justice here. Together we can map hate out of the picture.
