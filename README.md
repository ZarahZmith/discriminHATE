# Map Out Hate

The purpose of this project is to create a data set for micro-aggressions and discrimination. It is a safe space for people to report incidents that happen to them. It also provides resources for users to take further action and prepare themselves for various situations. When a user reports an incident, pins are posted on a map and they are able to visualize all other reports that have come in. [Explore the application](http://map-out-hate.herokuapp.com/).

# How to Use Map Out Hate as a Developer

2. Install [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/).
3. Create an access token for [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login).
4. Create a database with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

# Tools Used for Creation
This application utilizes Facebook's third party authentication to log in. Google's Map API for the map that allows users to visualize incidents. AnjularJS was used on the front end with sass and Bootstrap for styling. The backend uses NodeJS. Testing was done with Karma, Mocha, and Chai. The build process runts through Grunt. Heroku automatically deploys the site through the master branch on GitHub.

This project was created as a final project for The Iron Yard. Additionally, it is a passion project of mine to help make the world a little better. Having a data set on discrimination and micro-aggressions will help us to start addressing these issues with appropriate data to guide us in that mission.
